### Project Walkthrough: TondroAI CRM Frontend

#### 1. **High-Level Overview**

- **Stack:** Next.js (Pages Router), React, TypeScript, Material UI.
- **Purpose:** A modern CRM frontend with modular, component-driven architecture.
- **Key Features:**
  - Component-specific services for each domain (users, orgs, products, etc.)
  - Strong TypeScript usage for type safety.
  - Custom hooks for API and pagination.
  - Centralized error/success message system.
  - Modular, maintainable code structure.

#### 2. **Project Structure**

- **`src/components/`**: Large, feature-specific React components (e.g., `Organizations.tsx`, `Users.tsx`). Some are very large (1,000+ lines), which may indicate a need for further modularization.
- **`src/services/`**: Centralized API logic (e.g., `api.ts`), likely with domain-specific service classes.
- **`src/hooks/`**: Custom hooks for data fetching, pagination, and entity state.
- **`src/types/`**: Shared TypeScript types/interfaces.
- **`src/utils/`**: Utility functions (button styles, env validation, formatters).
- **`src/contexts/`**: React context for user roles.
- **`src/config/`**: Environment variable mapping and config.
- **`pages/`**: Next.js routes for main entities and API endpoints.
- **`public/`**: Static assets.

#### 3. **Key Architectural Patterns**

- **Service Isolation:** Each domain (users, orgs, etc.) has its own service for API calls and types.
- **Custom Hooks:** `useApi`, `usePagination`, etc., abstract common logic.
- **Centralized API Client:** Handles auth, errors, and interceptors.
- **Global Message System:** For user feedback (success/error).
- **Type Safety:** Strong use of TypeScript interfaces and types.

#### 4. **Best Practices Present**

- Modular file structure.
- TypeScript everywhere.
- Custom hooks for logic reuse.
- Centralized config and environment variable management.
- Error handling and user feedback via a global system.
- Test ID management for stable testing selectors (`testIds.ts`).

## **Missing Improvements & Expected Failures**

### **A. Code Quality & Maintainability**

- **Component Size:** Some components (e.g., `Organizations.tsx`, `Users.tsx`) are 1,000–2,000 lines. This is a code smell—consider breaking into smaller, focused components and containers.
- **Service Bloat:** `api.ts` is 1,000+ lines. Domain-specific service files (e.g., `organizationsService.ts`) would improve maintainability.

### **B. Testing**

- **Test Coverage:** No test files found in the main directories. There should be:
  - Unit tests for hooks and services.
  - Component tests (React Testing Library + Jest).
  - Integration tests for API routes.
- **Test IDs:** Good practice is present, but ensure all interactive elements use them.

### **C. Security**

- **API Route Security:** Need to verify that all sensitive logic (auth, role checks) is server-side only.
- **Input Validation:** Should use Zod/Yup in API routes for all user input.
- **Token Handling:** Ensure tokens are never exposed to the client and are stored securely (in-memory or HttpOnly cookies).

### **D. Performance & UX**

- **Component Memoization:** For large tables and lists, use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- **Optimistic UI:** For CRUD, consider optimistic updates for better UX.
- **Loading/Error States:** Ensure all async UI has proper loading and error states.

### **E. Modern/Trending Best Practices**

- **React Query/SWR:** Consider using React Query or SWR for data fetching, caching, and mutation instead of custom hooks for more robust state management.
- **Atomic Design:** Adopt atomic/component design for better reusability and scalability.
- **Feature Folders:** Group files by feature (not just type) for large projects.
- **Accessibility (a11y):** Ensure all components are accessible (ARIA, keyboard navigation).
- **Dark Mode/Theme Customization:** If not present, consider for modern UX.

### **F. DevOps & Tooling**

- **CI/CD:** No mention of CI/CD or automated lint/test/build in the README.
- **Pre-commit Hooks:** Husky is present, but ensure lint/test run on commit.
- **.env Management:** Ensure `.env.example` is up to date and secrets are never committed.

2. **Add/Expand Tests:** Unit, integration, and component tests.
3. **Adopt React Query/SWR:** For robust data fetching and caching.
4. **Improve Security:** Validate all API input, review token handling.
5. **Performance:** Memoize large lists/tables, optimize renders.
6. **Accessibility:** Audit and improve a11y.
7. **CI/CD:** Add automated lint/test/build on PRs.
8. **Documentation:** Add/expand code comments, keep README up to date.

# Code Review: identify potential issues, bugs, and areas for improvement. Check code quality and security enhancements

- Each component should have their own service and api calls, instead api.ts, same goes for interfaces, global messages, etc.
- favicon.ico and meta tags are missing
- Error boundary is missing
- Avoid inline-styling
- State management
- Rerendering of components - Proper usage of props and states
-
